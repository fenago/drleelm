# DrLeeLM Governance

## Stewardship
- **Primary Maintainer**: Dr. Ernesto Lee is the project owner.
- All strategic, architectural, and release decisions ultimately rest with the maintainer.
- Other contributors provide input through issues and pull requests but do not hold decision-making authority.

## Decision Process
1. Community discussion happens openly (issues, discussions, PR threads).
2. The maintainer reviews proposals, provides direction, and approves or rejects changes.
3. Once the maintainer approves, changes may be merged. Without explicit approval, changes cannot land.

## File Integrity
- `GOVERNANCE.md` is authoritative only when authored or directly approved by the maintainer.
- Any modification to this file made by someone other than the maintainer is **invalid** and should be reverted or resubmitted for confirmation.
- Repository maintainers should verify the commit history of this file to ensure the maintainer's authorship before relying on its contents.

## Updates
- Governance updates are initiated and finalized exclusively by the maintainer.
- Contributors with suggestions should open an issue and await explicit guidance before preparing a patch.

This structure keeps the project aligned with the maintainer's vision while welcoming community contributions under clear stewardship.
